# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning includes tasks for "labeled" data (i.e. you have a target variable).

In practice, it's often used as an advanced form of predictive modeling.
Each observation must be labeled with a "correct answer."
Only then can you build a predictive model because you must tell the algorithm what's "correct" while training it (hence, "supervising" it).
Regression is the task for modeling continuous target variables.
Classification is the task for modeling categorical (a.k.a. "class") target variables.

# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning includes tasks for "unlabeled" data (i.e. you do not have a target variable).

In practice, it's often used either as a form of automated data analysis or automated signal extraction.
Unlabeled data has no predetermined "correct answer."
You'll allow the algorithm to directly learn patterns from the data (without "supervision").
Clustering is the most common unsupervised learning task, and it's for finding groups within your data.

There are 5 core steps:

1
Exploratory Analysis
First, "get to know" the data. This step should be quick, efficient, and decisive.
2
Data Cleaning
Then, clean your data to avoid many common pitfalls. Better data beats fancier algorithms.
3
Feature Engineering
Next, help your algorithms "focus" on what's important by creating new features.
4
Algorithm Selection
Choose the best, most appropriate algorithms without wasting your time.
5
Model Training
Finally, train your models. This step is pretty formulaic once you've done the first 4.
